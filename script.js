/*What is the maximum number of moves in tic-tac-toe?
While the minimum number of moves to win a game is five, the maximum number of moves in any game is nine*/

/*think about what should be public or private*/

//Factory funtions return objects. Modules are the same, except they immediately invoke the function by putting "();"" at the end

/*When a space in the gameboard is clicked it will get the symbol of the current player and output it onto the board.
A player cannot place their symbol more than once per turn. */

/*The symbols should appear on the board based on the index in the game.Gameboard.gameboard index */

/*tic tac toe win conditions (can win within 5 to 8 rounds) if game reaches 9 rounds, its a tie
if player symbols are index's:
 0,1,2 or 3,4,5 or 6,7,8 (horizonal wins)
 0,3,6 or 1,4,7 or 2,5,8 (vertical wins)
 0,4,8 or 2,4,6 (diagnol wins)

 THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 8 WIN CONDITIONS

 Everytime a player or the computer(will worry about this later) inserts their symbol on the board, it will check for the win conditions
